# ACA-escape

BGN GOOGLE HACKATHON 2024

Our team collaborated to develop and style Afroescape, an event/community discovery website focused on Afro-Caribbean culture within your city.

We built a functional prototype in 48 hours, utilising Google Maps API and Ticketmaster API for increased user functionality.

We were additionally tasked with delivering an 8-minute presentation on Afroescapeâ€™s business model, technical stack, and future potential on curating cultural experiences.
